# 2014-DIP-Style
Twenty Fourteen WP Theme Dealer Inventory Plugin (DIP) Style

This is the initial Dealer Inventory Plugin (DIP) style for the WordPress Dealer Inventory Plugin.

This initial style is using the Twenty Fourteen WP theme to develop the style and guidelines for creating future DIP styles.  This repo is for demonstration purposes, as it's highly unlikely anyone will use the 2014 WP theme to build a car dealership website.

You may use this to guide to build your own styles, or please visit <a href="in-autos.com/shop/" target="_blank">in-autos.com</a> to buy a pre-built style for popular WordPress themes.

Should you have any questions, please ask right here on GitHub.  Of course, if you don't see something you wish to purchase, please drop us a note and we will try to get you a timeframe for availability.

Commercial styles (styles available for sale) will be developed in our private GitHub repos.  If you wish to see a particular feature added to an existing style, please let us know and we will explore the option.

Thank you,<br>
